Exercise 12.2
	Please see Contcomp.fs
Exercise 12.3
	Please see Contcomp.fs, CPar.fsy and CLex.fsl
	The constant optimization from exercise 12.2 is done, but jumps are still made.
Exercise 12.4
	Please see CPar.fsy.
	The code quality is slightly worse and we no longer have the if and while loop optimizations. There is ~10 extra instructions in the new code.
