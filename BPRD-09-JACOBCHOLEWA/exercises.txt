	ii) 	Then you would get the length of the list multiplied with two
	iii) 	The relation is that they function in the same way, but because the function is so simple we can replace the continuation with an accumelating integer.

Exercise 11.8
	i) 
		run (Every(Write(Prim("+", CstI 1, Prim("*", CstI 2, FromTo(1, 4))))));;
		run (Every(Write(  Prim("+", Prim("*", CstI 10, FromTo(2,4)), FromTo(1,2)))));;

	ii)	I assume that i'm looking for 56 and not 8 as in 8*7=56
		run (Write(  Prim("<", CstI 50, Prim("*", CstI 7, FromTo(1,10)))));;

	iii)	Please see the Icon.fs file
	iv) 	I have tested it using following: run (Write(Prim("<", CstI 50, Unary("multiples", CstI 7))));;
